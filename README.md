# Public API Requests
## Unit 5 Project for the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

This project uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees"
and uses that data to build a prototype for an employee directory.

Extra credit features: 
* Added search functionality to allow users to filter the directory by name
* Added toggle functionality to allow users to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open
* Style changes:
    * Changed background color & text color of employee card when user hovers over it
    * Changed background color of modal close button, next button and prev button when user hovers over them/clicks them.
    * Added click animation to employee card and modal close button
